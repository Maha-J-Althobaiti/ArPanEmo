# ArPanEmo
An Open-source Dataset for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition in Arabic Online Content during COVID-19 Pandemic

The dataset consists of 11,128 online posts manually labelled for ten emotion categories or neutral, with Fleiss’ kappa of 0.71. We have considered ```ten``` emotions, including six of the basic human emotions that were originally proposed by Ekman (1999):```anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise```. Additionally, we have incorporated four other emotions that we deemed pertinent to the pandemic period, namely, ```anticipation, confusion, optimism, and pessimism```. The number of instances are relatively balanced across emotion categories in ArPanEmo dataset.

ArPanEmo is unique in that it focuses on a specific dialect, namely Saudi, and covers topics related to healthcare and the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected various aspects of life.

The online posts were collected from three distinct online sources, namely, YouTube comments, online newspaper comments, and Twitter.
