# ArPanEmo
An Open-source Dataset for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition in Online Arabic Posts during COVID-19 Pandemic

ArPanEmo is a new dataset for fine-grained emotion recognition of online posts in Arabic. The dataset consists of 11,128 online posts manually labelled for ten emotion categories or neutral, with Fleiss’ kappa of 0.71. 

ArPanEmo is unique in that it focuses on a specific dialect, namely Saudi, and covers topics related to healthcare and the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected various aspects of life.

The online posts were collected from three distinct online sources, namely, YouTube comments, online newspaper comments, and Twitter. 

We have considered ```ten``` emotions, including six of the basic human emotions that were originally proposed by Ekman (1999):```anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise```. Additionally, we have incorporated four other emotions that we deemed pertinent to the pandemic period, namely, ```anticipation, confusion, optimism, and pessimism```. The number of instances are relatively balanced across emotion categories in ArPanEmo dataset.
